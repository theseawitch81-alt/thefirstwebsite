        <h1>The Guide Who Was Called: My Journey to You</h1>
        <img src="images/professional_photo.jpg" alt="[Your Name] - Professional Psychic and Coach" class="profile-photo"> 
        <p>My path to becoming your guide wasn't a choice I made, but a calling I couldn't ignore. For years, I was continually pulled toward the mysteries of spirit and intuition. My purpose is to now use that lifelong dedication to help you navigate your own unique journey.</p>

        <h2>Rooted in Intuition and Nurtured by Wisdom</h2>
        <p><strong>A Gift Nurtured Since Childhood:</strong> My intuitive connection wasn't something I discovered later in life—it was present from my earliest memories. I am eternally grateful that my mother recognized these gifts and provided the love and support needed to nurture them, creating the foundation for the clarity I offer today.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mastering the Maps of the Soul:</strong> My formal journey began at 16 when I first put hands on a Tarot deck. For over [X] years, the Tarot has been my trusted language, combined with my natural clairvoyance, to provide precise insights and actionable guidance.</p>
        
        <h2>My Philosophy: You Are the Co-Creator</h2>
        <p>My spiritual practice is rooted in Goddess-Centered Spirituality, which honors the cycles of the Divine Feminine and the Earth. Fundamentally, **I believe in your power.** My work is not about telling your fortune, but empowering you to become a confident co-creator with the divine—to manifest your happiest, most abundant, and soul-aligned life.</p>
